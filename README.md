# A* to Solve 14-puzzle problem using Manhattan Distance heuristic function

The 14-puzzle problem is similar to the 15-puzzle problem, but it has one extra empty cell; the empty cells are indicated by zeros. Just like the similar project in my profile, but with a different approach. <br>
In this project, I used the A* search algorithm to solve this problem. In it, I used the Manhattan Distance heuristic function. <br>
I left some initial forms of the problem as examples in the form of comments in the code.<br>
This project was written in 2020 and developed in Python, and is one of my academic projects.
